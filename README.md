Propagate
===

A starter environment for WordPress development

Description
-----------

Hi. I'm a starter theme called propagate. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

Installation
------------

1. Install compass:
    * `sudo gem install compass`
    * `npm update -g npm`
    * `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
2. Install git: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
3. Type `./propagate`
4. cd `wp-content/themes/propagate`
5. `compass watch`

Changelog
---------

6.5
* Reworked structure and wrote build script
* Added composer
